## Starting Strength Forum Rankings

Just a quick little Laravel app I hacked together one night so the guys at one of the weight lifting forums I frequent could track their lifts against each other. Not the cleanest code ever written *(throw it all in the routes file!)* but the focus was on getting it done as quickly as possible for people to play with, and I think it did a good job of accomplishing that :)
